## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- CSS flexbox (inside the purchase button)

### What I learned

I set my goal for the challenge to make a preview card using CSS Grid. I've never used it before, so at the beginning, i found it a quite difficult to make, but after a little research on the internet, it was a bit easier to use the grid.

### Continued development

- I would like to get better my layouts (flexbox, grid)
- I would like to try the projects as simple as possible -> a better readability, SEO...
- someday I would like to try to learn CSS framework to make websites easier
etc...
