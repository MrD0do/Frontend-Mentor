## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom variables

### What I learned

I set my own goal to make this project without any grid or flexbox features. Although it was a bit hard (unnecessary much), i've completed the project, so i hope that it will work very well, especially on mobile devices...

### Useful resources

- I didn't search for any resources for it, i was trying to do that myself
